   Features extracted: 42 (slope, CV, delta × 14 metrics)
   Coverage: 28/28 users with complete data
   Model 7 (Personality + temporal slopes): R² = -0.055 (no improvement over M1)
   Interpretation: Behavioral trends do not add to GPA prediction beyond personality
   Note: Temporal features may predict wellbeing (tested in Phase 9)

8. MULTI-OUTCOME PREDICTION (Phase 9)
   Combinations tested: 72 (4 models × 6 outcomes × 3 feature sets)

   Best R² per outcome (across all models & feature sets):
     GPA             R²=0.212 (Random Forest, Personality)
     PHQ-9           R²=0.468 (Elastic Net, Behavior)
     PSS             R²=0.559 (SVR, Personality)
     Loneliness      R²=0.396 (Ridge, Pers + Beh)
     Flourishing     R²=0.555 (SVR, Personality)
     PANAS-NA        R²=-0.078 (Elastic Net, Behavior)

   GPA cross-model validation (Personality features):
     Elastic Net     R²=0.126 p=0.010 *
     Ridge           R²=-0.024 p=1.000 
     Random Forest   R²=0.212 p=0.008 *
     SVR             R²=0.059 p=0.068 

   LPA profiles as predictors:
     Profile alone → GPA: R² = -0.067
     Personality + Profile → GPA: ΔR² = -0.039 (no improvement)

9. ML INTERPRETABILITY (Phase 11)
   SHAP Analysis:
     Personality → GPA (top 3 by mean |SHAP|):
       Conscientiousness: 0.0984
       Neuroticism: 0.0587
       Agreeableness: 0.0182
     Behavior → PHQ-9 (top 3 by mean |SHAP|):
       Mobility: 1.3896
       Digital Usage: 1.2896
       Audio Environment: 1.2162

   Cross-Model Feature Importance (Pers+Beh → GPA):
     Conscientiousness: 0.240
     Neuroticism: 0.161
     Proximity: 0.160
     Screen Time: 0.078
     Digital Usage: 0.077

10. KEY FINDINGS
   a) Conscientiousness is the strongest personality predictor of GPA
   b) Neuroticism shows negative association with academic performance
   c) Personality alone predicts GPA better than smartphone behavior alone
   d) Digital engagement and mobility relate to psychological wellbeing
   e) Four distinct personality-behavior profiles identified,
      differing significantly in stress and loneliness levels
   f) Personality moderates behavior-outcome links:
      E × Activity → GPA (ΔR²=0.221), C × Activity → Loneliness (ΔR²=0.213)
   g) Interaction features do not add predictive value beyond personality (M6 R²=0.112 < M1 R²=0.170)
   h) Temporal behavioral trends (slopes, stability, delta) also fail to improve
      GPA prediction (M7 R²=-0.055), reinforcing personality primacy for academics
   i) Cross-model validation: Personality → GPA significant in 2/4 models
      (Elastic Net p=0.010, Random Forest p=0.008); 5/12 GPA combos significant after Optuna tuning
   j) Behavior features best predict PHQ-9 (R²=0.468), not GPA —
      confirming differential prediction targets for personality vs behavior
   k) LPA behavioral profiles have no incremental predictive value for GPA
   l) Optuna Bayesian optimization improved RF Personality→GPA from R²=0.101 to R²=0.212
   m) SVR captures non-linear Behavior→GPA (R²=0.116, p=0.032), missed by linear models
   n) SHAP confirms Conscientiousness as #1 GPA predictor across all 4 models
   o) Cross-model feature ranking agreement: mean Kendall's τ=0.460 (4/6 pairs significant)

11. PAPER NARRATIVE

   Title (working): Personality Predicts Grades, Behavior Predicts Wellbeing:
     An Exploratory Multi-Method Study of Smartphone Sensing in College Students

   Core thesis: Smartphone behavioral sensing captures psychological state,
   not academic engagement. Personality traits (especially conscientiousness)
   remain the primary predictor of academic performance, while passively
   sensed behavioral patterns are informative for mental health screening.

   Narrative structure:
   1. PERSONALITY → GPA (direct path)
      - Best: RF LOO-CV R²=0.212 (p=0.008), EN R²=0.126 (p=0.010)
      - Conscientiousness is #1 predictor across all 4 models (SHAP-confirmed)
      - Optuna tuning improved RF from R²=0.101 → 0.212 (+110%)
      - Replicates Poropat (2009) meta-analysis with passive sensing era data

   2. BEHAVIOR → WELLBEING (not GPA) — with a non-linear exception
      - Behavior predicts PHQ-9 (R²=0.468) but NOT GPA via linear models
      - PLS-SEM: Digital→Wellbeing (β=-0.49*), Mobility→Wellbeing (β=0.38*)
      - KEY: SVR captures non-linear Behavior→GPA (R²=0.116, p=0.032)
        missed by Elastic Net (R²=-0.130) and Ridge (R²=-0.516)
      - SHAP: Mobility and Digital Usage are top behavioral drivers for PHQ-9

   3. PERSONALITY MODERATES BEHAVIOR EFFECTS
      - 7/120 significant moderation effects
      - E×Activity→GPA (ΔR²=0.221): activity benefits extraverts more
      - Explains why aggregate behavior→GPA path is null (heterogeneity)

   4. BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS DIFFERENTIATE STUDENT SUBGROUPS
      - 4 LPA profiles distinguish stress (p=0.024) and loneliness (p=0.023)
      - But not depression (PHQ-9 p=0.154) — aligns with behavior→wellbeing

   5. ML AS ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
      - Optuna Bayesian optimization: data-driven hyperparameter selection
      - SHAP: model-agnostic feature attribution across 4 methods
      - Cross-model consistency: Kendall's τ=0.460 (feature ranking agreement)
      - Non-linear discovery: SVR revealed behavior→GPA link invisible to linear models
      - 8 complementary analyses converge on personality-behavior dissociation

   Limitations:
   - Small sample (N=28), single institution, single term
   - Mediation paths underpowered (need N≥71 per Fritz & MacKinnon 2007)
   - Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
   - Android-only sample may not generalize
