   Best model: M1: Personality
   LOO-CV R² = 0.170
   RMSE = 0.355, MAE = 0.282
   Features selected: 2 / 5

3. BOOTSTRAP MEDIATION
   Tests: 40 (5 traits × 8 mediators)
   Significant indirect effects: 0
   Strongest indirect effects:
     conscientiousness → proximity_pc1 → GPA: ab = 0.117 [-0.007, 0.479]
     neuroticism → audio_pc1 → GPA: ab = 0.089 [-0.062, 0.352]
     agreeableness → activity_pc1 → GPA: ab = -0.073 [-0.255, 0.023]

4. PLS-SEM STRUCTURAL MODEL
   Significant paths: 2
     DIGITAL → WELLBEING: β = -0.489 [-0.797, -0.138] *
     MOBILITY → WELLBEING: β = 0.382 [0.127, 0.653] *
   Total effect (PERSONALITY → GPA): 0.574

5. LATENT PROFILE ANALYSIS
   Optimal k by BIC: 4
     Profile 0: n = 6
     Profile 1: n = 6
     Profile 2: n = 8
     Profile 3: n = 7
   Significant outcome differences:
     pss_total: H = 9.45, p = 0.0238
     loneliness_total: H = 9.53, p = 0.0231

6. MODERATION ANALYSIS
   Total tests: 120
   Significant interactions (bootstrap 95% CI): 7
     extraversion × activity_pc1 → GPA: ΔR²=0.221 β=0.382 [0.080, 1.252] *
     conscientiousness × activity_pc1 → Loneliness: ΔR²=0.213 β=-0.639 [-1.163, -0.139] *
     openness × digital_pc1 → GPA: ΔR²=0.197 β=-0.370 [-0.651, 0.585] 
     agreeableness × activity_pc1 → GPA: ΔR²=0.173 β=0.533 [-0.068, 1.342] 
     openness × face2face_pc1 → Loneliness: ΔR²=0.135 β=0.420 [-0.810, 0.845] 

7. TEMPORAL TREND FEATURES (Phase 8)
   Features extracted: 42 (slope, CV, delta × 14 metrics)
   Coverage: 28/28 users with complete data
   Model 7 (Personality + temporal slopes): R² = -0.055 (no improvement over M1)
   Interpretation: Behavioral trends do not add to GPA prediction beyond personality
   Note: Temporal features may predict wellbeing (tested in Phase 9)

8. MULTI-OUTCOME PREDICTION (Phase 9)
   Combinations tested: 72 (4 models × 6 outcomes × 3 feature sets)

   Best R² per outcome (across all models & feature sets):
     GPA             R²=0.175 (SVR, Behavior)
     PHQ-9           R²=0.468 (Elastic Net, Behavior)
     PSS             R²=0.468 (Ridge, Personality)
     Loneliness      R²=0.396 (Ridge, Pers + Beh)
     Flourishing     R²=0.495 (Elastic Net, Personality)
     PANAS-NA        R²=-0.078 (Elastic Net, Behavior)

   GPA cross-model validation (Personality features):
     Elastic Net     R²=0.126 p=0.010 *
     Ridge           R²=-0.024 p=1.000 
     Random Forest   R²=0.135 p=0.028 *
     SVR             R²=0.061 p=0.068 

   LPA profiles as predictors:
     Profile alone → GPA: R² = -0.067
     Personality + Profile → GPA: ΔR² = -0.039 (no improvement)

9. KEY FINDINGS
   a) Conscientiousness is the strongest personality predictor of GPA
   b) Neuroticism shows negative association with academic performance
   c) Personality alone predicts GPA better than smartphone behavior alone
   d) Digital engagement and mobility relate to psychological wellbeing
   e) Four distinct personality-behavior profiles identified,
      differing significantly in stress and loneliness levels
   f) Personality moderates behavior-outcome links:
      E × Activity → GPA (ΔR²=0.221), C × Activity → Loneliness (ΔR²=0.213)
   g) Interaction features do not add predictive value beyond personality (M6 R²=0.112 < M1 R²=0.170)
   h) Temporal behavioral trends (slopes, stability, delta) also fail to improve
      GPA prediction (M7 R²=-0.055), reinforcing personality primacy for academics
   i) Cross-model validation: Personality → GPA significant in 2/4 models
      (Elastic Net p=0.010, Random Forest p=0.028)
   j) Behavior features best predict PHQ-9 (R²=0.468), not GPA —
      confirming differential prediction targets for personality vs behavior
   k) LPA behavioral profiles have no incremental predictive value for GPA
