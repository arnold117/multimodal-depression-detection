NON-REPLICATION ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. CORRELATIONS NOT REPLICATED
   Extraversion → GPA:
     S1: r=+0.185 (p=.357, n.s.)  →  S2: r=-0.078 (p=.248, n.s.)
     Neither study significant. Direction reversal likely due to
     sampling variability around a near-zero true effect.
   Neuroticism → GPA:
     S1: r=-0.444 (p<.05)  →  S2: r=-0.051 (p=.451, n.s.)
     Fisher z = -1.98, p = 0.047 — effect significantly weaker in S2.
     Possible explanation: range restriction in GPA (Notre Dame SD=0.26
     vs Dartmouth SD=0.39) attenuates weaker trait-GPA associations.

2. ML R² NOT REPLICATED (3/4 models)
   Elastic Net, Ridge, Random Forest all show near-zero or negative R².
   Root cause: GPA ceiling effect at Notre Dame.
     - Study 1 (Dartmouth): GPA M=3.26, SD=0.39, range=[2.0, 3.9]
     - Study 2 (Notre Dame): GPA M=3.65, SD=0.26, range=[2.64, 4.00]
   With 75% of students above 3.5, ML models cannot learn meaningful
   variance splits. However, the permutation tests for EN (p=.045) and
   SVR (p=.005) confirm that personality carries signal above chance,
   even when R² is near zero — consistent with a real but small effect
   compressed by range restriction.

3. WHAT DID REPLICATE (CORE FINDING)
   ✓ Conscientiousness → GPA: r=+0.552 → r=+0.263 (both p<.05)
     Fisher z p=.103 — no significant difference between studies.
   ✓ SHAP: Conscientiousness = #1 predictor in ALL 4 models × BOTH studies
     (8/8 = 100% consistency)
   ✓ SVR Personality→GPA: R²>0 in both studies (p=.005 in S2)
   → The paper's central claim (Conscientiousness is the dominant
     personality predictor of GPA) is robustly supported.

4. BEHAVIOR → DEPRESSION: PARTIAL REPLICATION
   S1: Behavior→PHQ-9  R²=0.468 (Elastic Net, N=27)
   S2: Pers+Beh→CES-D  R²=0.313 (Random Forest, N=363)
   Note: different depression instruments (PHQ-9 vs CES-D),
   different behavior modalities (13 phone sensors vs 3 Fitbit),
   so direct R² comparison is not appropriate. Direction consistent:
   behavior predicts depression in both studies.
